## Welcome to my profile!
My name is Guilherme d'Almeida, and I'm a junior full-stack web developer passionate about building effective digital solutions. 
I'm currently leveraging my problem-solving skills to tackle a real-world challenge.

## What I'm working on
I'm currently developing GDL, which stands for Gerador de Documentos Legislativos (Legislative Documents Generator). 
This project is designed to solve a significant problem for small legislative bodies across Brazil: the uncontrolled, unorganized, and slow process of creating official documents.

I am building GDL to automate and streamline these workflows, providing a standardized and efficient tool for legislative assemblies. 
This project is a key part of my journey :pray: to master full-stack development!
